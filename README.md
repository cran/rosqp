# rosqp

Provides R-bindings to the [OSQP-solver](http://osqp.readthedocs.io/)

OSQP is a sparse Quadratic Programming Solver suitable for large problems. 
It solves problems of the form:
$$ argmin(x) 0.5 x'P x + q'x $$

$$s.t.:  l_i <= (Ax)_i <= u_i$$

with P Positive semidefinite

### Example
```{r}
library(rosqp)
## example, adapted from ?quadprog::solve.QP
Dmat       <- diag(3)
dvec       <- c(0,-5,0)
Amat       <- matrix(c(-4, 2, 0, -3, 1, -2, 0, 0, 1),3,3)
bvec       <- c(-8,2,0)
res = solve_osqp(Dmat, dvec, Amat, bvec)
print(res$x)
